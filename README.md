# COVID-19-Global-Data-Tracker
A data analysis and reporting notebook (or app) that tracks global COVID-19 trends. The project will analyze cases, deaths, recoveries, and vaccinations across countries and time.

# summary.
A Python-based project to track, analyze, and visualize COVID-19 trends worldwide.
This project uses real-world data to explore cases, deaths, and vaccination progress across different countries and over time.
The goal is to practice data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and visualization skills while producing a report suitable for presentation.

# Objectives
Import and clean COVID-19 global data.

Analyze trends in cases, deaths, and vaccinations over time.

Compare COVID-19 metrics between countries and regions.

Visualize trends using charts and (optionally) a choropleth world map.

Summarize findings in a clear, well-documented report.

# Tools & Libraries Used
Python 3.8+

Jupyter Notebook (or VS Code with Jupyter extension)

pandas — data loading and cleaning

matplotlib — static visualizations

plotly — interactive maps

seaborn  — advanced charts

# Insights & Reflections
The progression of COVID-19 cases varied significantly across countries, with vaccination rollouts influencing recovery rates.

Nations with faster vaccine adoption saw reduced death rates over time.

Peaks in daily cases often correlated with seasonal changes and policy shifts (e.g., lockdowns, mask mandates).

Data inconsistencies and reporting delays were notable challenges, reinforcing the importance of careful data cleaning.

Visual storytelling through charts and maps proved essential for communicating trends effectively.
